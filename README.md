# Lessons Learned

The Lessons Learned project is a website that brings together a series of information about what was learned during the three blocks of the course at Trybe. The site was developed with the aim of presenting positioned and stylized elements, in addition to ensuring appropriate semantics to improve accessibility and ranking in search engines.

In this project, the following technologies were used:

- **HTML:** HTML was used to build the web pages of the site, allowing the structure and organization of the content.

- **Semantic HTML:** The concept of semantic HTML was applied to make pages more accessible and optimize ranking in search engines.

- **CSS:** CSS was used to add style to the site and position elements properly.

This project is an excellent opportunity to practice web development skills and apply the concepts learned throughout the course.
